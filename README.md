A car ui and back end AI pathfinding

To use download and run the executable

Draw a set of black walls by clicking and holding the mouse

Hit enter to start the path finding process ( this will take a minute and the window saying it is unresponsive is a known issue )

Hit backspace to delete all walls and restart the process

The most unique part of this project is the Priority Queue which uses a joint Dictionary and Heap for efficient duplicate check and replacements, as well as fast access to the smallest values.
